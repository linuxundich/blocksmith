//! Internationalization setup (GNU gettext). Source strings throughout
//! this codebase are German (the app's original/default language, not a
//! translation of anything) - `tr()` marks a string as translatable and
//! looks it up in the current locale's compiled catalog, falling back to
//! returning the German text unchanged if no catalog is bound or no
//! matching locale is found. That fallback is what makes this safe to
//! introduce incrementally: a string nobody has wrapped in `tr()` yet
//! simply stays exactly as it always was.
//!
//! Currently applied to a representative slice of the UI (the main
//! window's header bar/menu/tabs, the "Artikel-Eigenschaften" dialog, and
//! the "Tastenkürzel" window) as a working, end-to-end proof that the
//! pipeline is wired correctly - not yet to every string in the app.
//! Converting the rest is the same mechanical step repeated: wrap a
//! literal in `i18n::tr("...")`, then add its translation to `po/en.po`
//! (or a new `po/<lang>.po`).
//!
//! Deliberately calls `bindtextdomain`/`textdomain` directly rather than
//! using this crate's `TextDomain` convenience builder: that builder ties
//! catalog selection to whatever `setlocale()` actually resolves to
//! (checking a matching directory exists for that *exact* locale before
//! binding anything at all), which fails outright on a system that has
//! the desktop's own locale installed (say, `de_DE.UTF-8`) but not the
//! *target* one (`en_US.UTF-8` - exactly this dev machine's situation, and
//! plausibly a minimal Flatpak runtime's too). Calling `setlocale(LC_ALL,
//! "")` once to adopt the real environment, then binding the domain
//! unconditionally, lets glibc's own runtime fallback chain (`LANGUAGE`,
//! then `LC_MESSAGES`/`LANG`) resolve which catalog to use on each lookup
//! instead - the standard GNOME convention of overriding just one app's
//! language via `LANGUAGE=xx` independent of the desktop's own locale
//! keeps working, and a locale/catalog that doesn't exist yet is simply
//! never found, with no error to handle at all.
//!
//! See `po/README.md` for the translator-facing workflow and `build.rs`
//! for how `.po` files are compiled to the `.mo` catalogs gettext reads.
