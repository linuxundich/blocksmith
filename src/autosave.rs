//! Local crash-recovery: while the buffer holds unsaved text, a periodic
//! snapshot of the current article is written to a single recovery slot -
//! this app only ever has one document open at a time (see `window.rs`), so
//! there's no need for anything keyed by document. Piggybacks on the same
//! debounced buffer-`changed` tick that already drives the live preview
//! (`window.rs`'s `wire_live_preview`) rather than running its own timer.
//! Cleared the moment its content is safely on disk (a real save) or no
//! longer relevant (a fresh "Neu", or a different article was just opened).
