# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.50.7] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- The Bildbeschriftung dialog's thumbnail was still blank after the
  previous fix - `load_html` was called on the WebView immediately after
  construction, before it had a real size or was even part of the
  dialog's widget tree yet, and never repainted once it was actually
  shown. Deferred loading to the widget's `map` signal instead.

## [0.50.6] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- The Bildbeschriftung dialog's image thumbnail rendered as a blank white
  box for a WebP source (this app's own default export format) on a
  system without the `webp-pixbuf-loader` package - `Gtk.Picture` depends
  on that separate, easy-to-miss gdk-pixbuf plugin, which this app never
  otherwise needed. Renders through WebKit instead, which already decodes
  WebP natively for the Vorschau pane and Browser tab regardless.
- The dialog's fixed 560px height cropped the Bildunterschrift field on
  anything but the shortest content. Raised the cap and let the content
  area size to what's actually there instead of always clipping to it.

## [0.50.5] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- The preview kept snapping back to the top while actively typing -
  every debounced re-render on a body edit reset scroll to 0 regardless
  of where the cursor-follow sync had just moved it to. Content updates
  now preserve the current scroll position across the reload instead.

### Changed

- Reworked how Alternativtext and Bildunterschrift map onto Markdown
  image syntax: `![Bildunterschrift](bild.png "Alternativtext")` - the
  bracket text (what you actually see when typing `![]()`) is now the
  caption, and the title is the alt text, the opposite of CommonMark's
  usual pairing. Both fields are now kept in sync with the Markdown in
  both directions, seeded from the live source when the dialog opens and
  written back when it closes. Renamed the dialog and its context-menu
  entry from "Alternativtext" to "Bildbeschriftung" to reflect that it
  now manages both fields equally.

## [0.50.4] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- Scroll-sync now also follows the cursor, not just scrolling - typing or
  moving the cursor somewhere already visible in the editor now brings the
  matching spot into view in the preview too, instead of only reacting
  when the editor itself is scrolled.

### Changed

- Alternativtext and Bildunterschrift are now handled very differently in
  the Alternativtext dialog: alt text is dialog-only and never reads from
  or writes to the Markdown bracket text, so it can't be silently changed
  by editing the article. Bildunterschrift is the opposite - it's kept in
  sync with the Markdown's title slot (`![alt](bild.png "Bildunterschrift")`)
  in both directions: the dialog now seeds the field from the live title
  instead of a possibly-stale cached value, and writes the final text back
  into that slot when the dialog closes.

## [0.50.3] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- A "aus dem Bildtext im Markdown übernehmen" button next to the
  Alternativtext dialog's Alternativtext and Bildunterschrift fields -
  `reconcile` deliberately leaves an already-edited alt text/caption alone
  on every later article edit, so it can quietly drift from the Markdown
  bracket text with no indication of that in the dialog; this gives an
  explicit way back instead of a silent overwrite.

### Changed

- Redesigned the Alternativtext dialog: shows a thumbnail of the actual
  image (for a local file that still resolves) plus the filename, and
  splits Alternativtext and Bildunterschrift into two clearly labeled
  groups explaining what each is for, instead of one plain list of rows
  that made the two easy to confuse.

## [0.50.2] - 2026-09-21

### Changed

- Scroll-sync now glides smoothly to its target instead of snapping there
  instantly - noticeable when a source line maps to a preview position far
  down the page (e.g. scrolling past a large image or the YouTube/Vimeo
  embed placeholder). The echo-guard that stops this from bouncing back
  and forth between editor and preview now waits for the scroll animation
  to actually finish (`scrollend`) rather than a fixed timeout, so a
  longer glide doesn't get interrupted mid-animation.

## [0.50.1] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Scroll-sync's editor-to-preview direction could fall far short of the
  preview's actual end when scrolling the editor all the way down (e.g.
  via Ctrl+End) - the check compared `GtkTextView`'s pixel-based
  `vadjustment` bounds, which are only an *estimate* until the whole
  document has been scrolled through and stayed stale (too small) right
  after a big jump. Now compares logical buffer line numbers instead,
  which don't have that problem.

## [0.50.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- YouTube/Vimeo (and other recognized oEmbed providers) links on their own
  line now show a placeholder card in the Vorschau pane instead of plain
  link text - sized to a real 16:9 box, so scroll-sync accounts for its
  height the same way it already does for a large image.
- Scroll-sync between editor and preview now works in both directions
  (scrolling the preview moves the editor too, not just the other way
  around), and the editor-side line estimate now reads the real cursor
  position from the widget instead of a line-count proportion - fixed a
  drift that showed up once word wrap was involved.
- Artikel-Eigenschaften: the featured image can now get an AI-generated
  alt text too, via the same dialog body images already use.
- Artikel-Eigenschaften: a "KI-Tags vorschlagen…" button next to the Tags
  field analyzes the article and suggests tags, preferring the site's own
  existing tags over inventing near-duplicates.
- A new "KI-Bildunterschrift generieren…" action (editor context menu and
  the preview's image right-click menu) drafts an image caption from the
  surrounding article text, targeting 20-25 words.
- Clicking a link in the Vorschau pane now opens it in the Browser tab
  instead of navigating the preview itself away from the article; the
  Browser tab also gained a button to copy its current address.

### Fixed

- The article slug's "generate automatically" button had lost its icon
  (it referenced an icon name that doesn't exist in the current theme).

## [0.49.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- Ten more editor color schemes in Einstellungen → Erscheinungsbild → Farbe
  - five dark (Dracula, Nord, Gruvbox Dark, Monokai, Catppuccin Mocha) and
    five light (Gruvbox Light, One Light, GitHub Light, Catppuccin Latte,
    Rosé Pine Dawn) - each a real, hand-authored GtkSourceView scheme
    covering the full standard style set (headings, emphasis, links,
    lists, code, ...), not just a token color swap.
- "Alle hochladen" in the export dialog's "Medien" tab now also uploads
  the article's featured image if one's pending, alongside every body
  image - previously it silently only covered body images, and the
  featured image needed its own separate button.

### Fixed

- The "Gutenberg-Code" tab and the export dialog's own "Vorschau" tab both
  showed the Gutenberg HTML converted straight from the raw Markdown
  source, with no way to reflect alt-text/caption edits made in
  Medienverwaltung - so a caption set there (with nothing written as a
  Markdown image title) silently never appeared in either preview, even
  though the real publish already sent it correctly. Both now show
  exactly what would actually be published.

## [0.48.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- Revision-conflict awareness: re-exporting an already-published post now
  first re-fetches its current content from WordPress and compares it
  against a locally-remembered baseline (set on import and after every
  successful publish/update) - if it changed on the server since (edited
  directly in wp-admin, most likely), a confirmation dialog asks whether
  to overwrite that change before sending anything, instead of silently
  clobbering it. Skipped entirely for a new post or a `.md` file written
  before this baseline existed, since there's nothing to compare against;
  also skipped (fails open) if the check itself can't complete, so a
  transient network hiccup never blocks publishing outright.
- Pasting rich text (Ctrl+V) now converts real formatting instead of just
  dropping it: if the clipboard holds a `text/html` entry alongside its
  plain-text one - copied from a browser, word processor, or anywhere
  else - it's converted to Markdown and inserted in its place, using a
  real HTML5 parser rather than a hand-rolled one to hold up against the
  wide variety of real-world HTML sources (Google Docs, Word, web pages)
  actually produce. An image on the clipboard still takes priority, same
  as before; plain text with no HTML entry pastes exactly as it did
  before.

## [0.47.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- A plain launch (no file argument) now reopens the most recently opened/
  saved article instead of always starting at a blank "Unbenannt"
  document - `Ctrl+N` still gets to a blank one in one step.
- The featured image can now have its own alt text: a new "Alt-Text für
  Aufmacherbild" field in Artikel-Eigenschaften, sent as the resulting
  WordPress media attachment's `alt_text` on upload, the same way a body
  image's alt text already was - previously only body images ever got
  one.
- A non-blocking warning appears once an alt text (body image, featured
  image, or the quick-edit dialog) gets unusually long - WCAG guidance
  suggests staying well under 150 characters, since a screen reader reads
  the whole thing aloud; the warning is a hint, not a hard limit.
- A new WordPress "Privat" post status, alongside Entwurf/Ausstehend/
  Veröffentlicht/Geplant - a "Privat veröffentlichen" button appears in
  the export dialog once it's picked in Artikel-Eigenschaften, the same
  way "Terminieren" already does for "Geplant".
- Two more Gutenberg blocks via the same fenced-code-block pattern
  `columns`/`buttons`/`gallery` already established: ` ```pullquote ` (a
  highlighted quote with an optional citation) and ` ```details ` (a
  collapsible summary/body disclosure widget, `wp:details` in modern
  WordPress) - both with full round-trip support back to the same
  Markdown when re-opening an existing post.
- A "Vorschau öffnen" button in the export dialog, shown once an article
  already exists on WordPress but isn't published yet - it opens
  WordPress's own unpublished-post preview link in the app's Browser tab,
  switching to it automatically. Uses that tab's existing WebKit session,
  so it only actually shows the live preview if that session is already
  logged into wp-admin; otherwise it shows a login page instead, which
  the button's tooltip and a status message both note up front.

## [0.46.2] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- A CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): every push/PR now runs
  `cargo build`/`test`/`clippy` automatically, instead of that protection
  only existing when someone remembered to run them by hand before
  pushing. Runs in an `archlinux:latest` container rather than the
  default Ubuntu runner image - this app links against a fairly recent
  GNOME stack (libadwaita 1.7+, GtkSourceView 5.4+, WebKitGTK 6.0,
  libspelling), and Arch's rolling-release `pacman` always has current
  versions of all of them, so there's no separate "is the distro new
  enough yet" question to keep revisiting over time.

## [0.46.1] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- The same image referenced more than once in an article (a logo, a
  divider, reused several times) could end up showing one occurrence's
  "Alt" badge on every other occurrence too, and silently lose whichever
  occurrence's alt text/caption wasn't edited last. Root cause:
  `media::reconcile` created a separate `MediaItem` per occurrence on the
  first scan, but every place that reads the list afterward (the
  preview's badges, Medienverwaltung's rows, `sync_uploads`) already
  matches by `source` alone and expects at most one entry per source - so
  the *next* reconcile silently collapsed every occurrence into a clone
  of whichever one it found first, discarding the others. `reconcile` now
  deduplicates by `source` up front, so a repeated image gets exactly one
  `MediaItem`, consistently shared by every occurrence.

## [0.46.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- Medienverwaltung: an "Alle hochladen" button uploads every not-yet-
  uploaded image in the article in one go instead of one at a time - a
  progress bar tracks it ("N von M hochgeladen"), each row updates live as
  its own upload finishes, and a final summary reports full success or how
  many failed and why. A failure partway through doesn't stop the rest -
  it's recorded and the batch continues.
- The preview pane's right-click menu on an image now also offers
  "Alternativtext bearbeiten…" - the same manual alt-text/caption dialog
  the editor's own context menu already opens - alongside "KI-
  Alternativtext generieren…" and "Bild bearbeiten…", so a plain (non-AI)
  edit no longer requires switching to the editor or Medienverwaltung
  first.
- Hovering an image's "Alt" badge in the preview now shows the actual alt
  text as its tooltip, instead of a generic "Alternativtext ist
  definiert" sentence that looked identical for every image.
- The AI alt-text generator's detail level (Standard/Ausführlich/Hohe
  Genauigkeit) is now remembered across uses instead of always resetting
  to Standard.

### Fixed

- The editor's context menu always showed "Alternativtext festlegen…"/
  "KI-Alternativtext generieren…", even when right-clicking a line with no
  image on it at all (clicking either then just popped an explanation
  dialog). Both items now only appear when the clicked line actually
  holds a media reference, rebuilding the menu section live from the
  cursor position on every secondary click.
- Image captions weren't shown in the preview at all - only in the
  exported Gutenberg HTML (see 0.45.0). A caption now renders as a small
  line under the image in the preview too, read from the same
  `MediaItem.caption` Medienverwaltung and the alt-text dialogs already
  edit, not from the Markdown source's own (rarely re-parsed) `"title"`
  text.
- The preview's right-click menu on an image still showed WebKit's own
  default image actions ("Bild in neuem Fenster öffnen"/"Bild speichern
  unter"/"Bild kopieren"/"Bildadresse kopieren") - saving/copying the
  rendered file itself makes no sense for an embedded article image, and
  they're now trimmed the same way the default navigation items already
  were.
- The AI alt-text generator started generating a Standard-detail
  suggestion immediately when the dialog opened, before the reviewer got
  a chance to pick a different detail level first. Generation now only
  starts once "Text generieren" is actually clicked.
- Clicking "Übernehmen" in the AI alt-text dialog reset the preview's
  scroll position back to the top - jarring since the dialog is opened
  from a specific point in the article the reviewer was actually looking
  at. The current scroll position is now read via JavaScript before the
  reload and restored once the refreshed page has loaded.

## [0.45.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- "Slug aus Titel generieren" button next to the Slug field in Artikel-
  Eigenschaften - a new `document::slugify()` mirrors WordPress's own
  `sanitize_title()`/`remove_accents()` closely enough that the result
  matches what WordPress itself would produce from the same title (ä/ö/ü
  flattened to a/o/u and ß to ss, not the ae/oe/ue spelling some other
  tools use), so publishing never ends up with a different slug than the
  one shown here.
- "URL-Länge (SEO)" row in Artikel-Eigenschaften, right below the Slug
  field: shows the full URL the post would actually publish at (domain +
  category + slug, not just the slug in isolation) with its character
  count, and a green checkmark once it's within Google's ~73-character
  search-result truncation, or a warning past it. Needs the category's
  real WordPress slug, not a guess from its name - the two can diverge
  (e.g. a category renamed without updating its slug) - so `termcache.rs`
  now also caches each category's real slug alongside its name, and
  `wpclient::Term` gained a `slug` field to carry it.
- The featured image can now be uploaded from Medienverwaltung itself: a
  new "Aufmacherbild" row at the top of the list, with its own "Zu
  WordPress hochladen" button, shows whether one is set, pending upload,
  or already on WordPress. Previously the only way to get a featured
  image onto WordPress at all was the implicit, always-re-uploading step
  buried inside every single publish.
- The export dialog's status line now shows the published post's real
  permalink as a clickable `Gtk.LinkButton` once a publish/draft/schedule
  succeeds, instead of a plain, unclickable line of text.

### Fixed

- Only the first 100 categories/tags on the WordPress site ever reached
  the properties dialog's autocomplete - `wpclient::Client::list_term_names`/
  `list_terms` fetched a single `per_page=100` page and never paginated
  further, so any tag sorting alphabetically past roughly the hundredth
  (a real problem on a blog with 1600+ tags) could never be found or
  suggested. Both now page through `X-WP-TotalPages` until exhausted.
- A caption set on an image (via Markdown's `![alt](src "title")` syntax,
  or Medienverwaltung's "Bildunterschrift" field) never actually showed up
  on the published post - two separate bugs. First, the Gutenberg renderer
  wrote a caption as an invisible `<img title="">` hover tooltip instead
  of a real `<figcaption>`; fixed to match WordPress's own image-block
  markup. Second, and more seriously, an alt-text/caption edit made in
  Medienverwaltung was never written back into the article's Markdown
  body at all, so export re-parsed the same old (or absent) text every
  time - the edit only ever reached the WordPress *media library's*
  attachment metadata (via `sync_uploads`'s `update_media_metadata`),
  which the already-published post's baked-in HTML never re-reads. Export
  now overlays `Frontmatter.media`'s alt text/caption onto the freshly
  parsed image blocks before rendering, so a Medienverwaltung edit reaches
  the actual published `<img>`/`<figcaption>`, not just the invisible
  attachment record.

## [0.44.1] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- At real narrow widths (tiling WMs squeezing the window down around
  ~360-400px), the Ctrl+F search-and-replace bar was still logging
  `AdwToastOverlay ... exceeds AdwApplicationWindow width` and preventing
  the window from being resized that small in the first place. Its
  `Gtk.Revealer` only collapses *height* while hidden, not width, so its
  full row (two entries, "Alle ersetzen", etc.) was silently setting the
  editor pane's minimum width regardless of whether the bar was visible.
  Wrapped in the same horizontal-only `Gtk.ScrolledWindow` treatment the
  formatting toolbar already got in 0.44.0.

## [0.44.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- Adaptive layout via libadwaita breakpoints: below ~700sp of window width
  (a tiled quarter of a typical monitor, or a Linux tablet in portrait),
  the editor and sidebar (Vorschau/Gutenberg-Code/Statistik/Chat/Browser)
  stop competing for a side-by-side `Gtk.Paned` split and switch to a
  single pane at a time, toggled by an `Adw.InlineViewSwitcher` styled
  like the sidebar's own tab switcher. Widening the window back past the
  breakpoint restores the side-by-side layout automatically.
- The formatting toolbar above the editor now scrolls horizontally
  instead of clipping when the window is narrower than its full row of
  buttons, so nothing (including the "…" overflow menu) becomes
  unreachable at narrow widths.

## [0.43.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- The "Lesbarkeit" row in the Statistik tab is now an expandable section
  explaining *why* the score comes out the way it does - the exact
  formula, the article's actual average words-per-sentence and
  syllables-per-word, and concrete, actionable tips (e.g. "Sätze sind im
  Schnitt sehr lang - in zwei kürzere aufteilen") derived from whichever
  of those two measurements is actually dragging the score down, instead
  of leaving the number as an unexplained black box.

## [0.42.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- Basic ad/tracker blocking in the Browser tab, built on the same
  WebKit "content blocker" mechanism GNOME Web itself uses
  (`WebKitUserContentFilterStore`/`WebKitUserContentManager`) - not a
  hand-rolled list of domains in Rust code, but a real EasyList-syntax
  data file (`data/adblock/easylist-basic.txt`) parsed by a genuine
  (if deliberately basic) EasyList-to-WebKit-rules converter, so the
  block list can grow just by adding more standard `||domain^` lines,
  no code change needed. On by default; a new "Werbung blockieren"
  toggle in the new "Browser" Einstellungen page turns it off (or back
  on) live, no restart required.

## [0.41.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- A "Browser" page in Einstellungen: the Browser tab's start page is now
  configurable (defaults to Startpage) instead of always opening the
  same hardcoded page.

## [0.40.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- A "Browser" tab next to Chat in the right-hand pane: a plain `WebKit`
  view with an address bar and back/forward/reload controls for opening
  any website (documentation, the live target site, reference material)
  without leaving Blocksmith. Typing a bare domain adds `https://`
  automatically; anything else is sent to Google as a search query, the
  same way a normal browser's address bar behaves.

## [0.39.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- Edit an image directly from the preview: right-click a rendered image
  in the Vorschau pane → "Bild bearbeiten…" opens a dialog to convert it
  to PNG, JPEG, or WebP and/or resize it by width or height, with an
  optional "Seitenverhältnis beibehalten" toggle for a free (non-
  proportional) resize. Writes a new sibling file (`photo.png` →
  `photo-bearbeitet.webp`) and updates the article's own `![alt](src)`
  reference to it - the original file is left untouched on disk. WebP
  encoding uses the new `webp` crate (PNG/JPEG stay on `gdk-pixbuf`, same
  as `imagecompress.rs`) since `gdk-pixbuf`'s own WebP support, where
  installed at all, is read-only.

## [0.38.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- Gutenberg block coverage: Columns, Buttons, Gallery. Since Markdown has
  no native syntax for these, they're written as fenced code blocks with
  a special "language" tag - ` ```columns `, splitting its content into
  side-by-side columns on any line containing exactly `+++` (each side
  re-parsed as ordinary Markdown, so a column can hold anything an
  article body can); ` ```buttons `, one Markdown link per line, each
  becoming a call-to-action button; ` ```gallery `, one Markdown image
  reference per line. Full round-trip support both ways (export to real
  `wp:columns`/`wp:buttons`/`wp:gallery` block HTML, and back to the same
  Markdown when re-opening an existing post via "Von WordPress öffnen").
  Local images referenced inside a `columns`/`gallery` block are now also
  found by Medienverwaltung (alt text, upload tracking) and get their
  local path substituted for the real WordPress URL on export, the same
  as an image anywhere else in the article.

## [0.37.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- RankMath SEO field support - a new "RankMath SEO" group in
  Artikel-Eigenschaften (SEO-Titel, SEO-Beschreibung, Fokus-Keyword) sends
  RankMath's own post meta keys (`rank_math_title`/
  `rank_math_description`/`rank_math_focus_keyword`) on export and reads
  them back when opening an existing post - previously the app never sent
  any `meta` fields at all, so any SEO plugin data had to be re-entered
  by hand in wp-admin after every publish from Blocksmith. Harmless on a
  site without RankMath active, since WordPress's REST API silently
  drops an unrecognized meta key rather than erroring.

## [0.36.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- GNOME/Linux desktop integration - the three quick wins from that
  analysis:
  - **File association**: the `.desktop` file now declares
    `MimeType=text/markdown;`, and the app handles being launched with a
    file argument (`Gio::ApplicationFlags::HANDLES_OPEN`) - double-
    clicking a `.md` file, or "Open With" → Blocksmith, in Nautilus now
    works. Since this is a single-window app, a file opened while an
    instance is already running loads into that same window instead of
    spawning a second one.
  - **Shared "recently used" list**: opening or saving a `.md` file now
    also registers it with `Gtk.RecentManager`, GNOME's own shared
    recent-files list - the file now shows up in GNOME Files' "Zuletzt
    verwendet" view and other apps' native file-open dialogs, not just
    Blocksmith's own "Zuletzt geöffnet" popover.
  - **Desktop notifications**: publishing, an image upload, or a link
    check finishing while the window isn't focused now raises a
    `Gio::Notification` (works under Flatpak via the notification portal,
    no extra permission needed) - previously the only sign anything
    happened was an in-dialog status label, invisible if you'd switched
    away during a slow upload.

## [0.35.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- Broken-link checker: a new "Links" tab in the export dialog, alongside
  Vorschau and Medien. It scans the article for every unique `http(s)://`
  URL - Markdown link and image destinations, plus bare URLs on their own
  line that export as `wp:embed` blocks - and, on demand ("Links
  prüfen"), HEADs each one (falling back to GET if a server rejects HEAD)
  to catch a typo'd URL or a since-deleted page before it ships silently
  as part of the published post.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- Post excerpt / meta description: a new "Auszug / Meta-Beschreibung"
  field in Artikel-Eigenschaften is sent as WordPress's own `excerpt`
  field on export, and read back when opening an existing post via "Von
  WordPress öffnen" - previously the field didn't exist at all, so
  WordPress fell back to an auto-truncated (often mid-sentence) chunk of
  the body for RSS feeds, social share cards, and archive listings.
- Readability hint in the Statistik tab: a German-adapted Flesch
  reading-ease score (Amstad's formula) plus a qualitative label ("Sehr
  leicht" through "Sehr schwer"), computed from average sentence length
  and average syllables per word - a lightweight signal for "this
  paragraph is getting hard to read" that nothing in the app surfaced
  before.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- Internationalization completed: essentially the whole UI is now
  translatable (every dialog, menu, toolbar, tooltip, toast, and status/
  error message), up from the representative slice shipped in v0.31.0.
  `po/en.po` is a complete, real English translation of all ~270 extracted
  strings. AI prompt content and proper nouns (WordPress, provider names,
  "Application Password") deliberately stay untranslated - see
  `po/README.md` for the full list and the pluralization convention used
  for dynamic messages.

### Fixed

- A test in `i18n.rs` was leaking global `LANGUAGE=en` state into the rest
  of the test process, causing other tests' `tr()` calls to unexpectedly
  return English instead of the untranslated German they asserted -
  discovered live once other tests started calling `tr()` too. Now
  restores the environment/gettext domain it changes.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- Drag a local file into the editor: dropping one or more files from a
  file manager onto the editor inserts them the same way as "Bild
  einfügen"/clipboard paste - works even in an unsaved article (falling
  back to the file's absolute path).
- "Kategorien & Tags verwalten" dialog (reachable from Artikel-
  Eigenschaften): lists every existing WordPress category/tag and lets
  you rename or permanently delete one directly, instead of only ever
  being able to read (autocomplete) or create a term automatically on
  publish.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- Image compression before upload: an oversized PNG/JPEG referenced in an
  article is downscaled and re-encoded before it's sent to WordPress
  (an opaque PNG converting to JPEG when that's smaller) - an
  already-small image is uploaded unchanged.
- Fokus-Schreibmodus (Ctrl+Shift+F): hides the header bar, editor
  toolbar, and preview pane down to just the editor text, for
  distraction-free writing.
- Internationalization: the app is now translatable via GNU gettext.
  A representative slice of the UI (the main window's header bar/menu/
  tabs, "Artikel-Eigenschaften", "Tastenkürzel") is wired up and has a
  complete English translation (`po/en.po`) proving the pipeline works
  end to end; the rest of the app's strings are converted the same way
  incrementally. See `po/README.md` for the translator/contributor
  workflow.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- Embed blocks: a bare URL alone on its own line (YouTube, X/Twitter,
  Vimeo, Instagram, SoundCloud, Spotify, or any other) now exports as a
  real `wp:embed` block instead of staying a plain link.
- Video/audio support: local video and audio files are inserted with the
  same `![]()` syntax as images (via a new "Video/Audio einfügen" toolbar
  button, or Ctrl+V/drag from a file manager into the picker), upload to
  WordPress's media library, and export as real `wp:video`/`wp:audio`
  blocks. The live preview shows an actual player instead of a broken
  image icon.
- Scheduled publishing: a new "Geplant" status in Artikel-Eigenschaften
  with a publish date/time field, and a "Terminieren" button in the
  export dialog. Reopening an already-scheduled WordPress post restores
  its scheduled time.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- Suchen und Ersetzen (Ctrl+F): a bar at the bottom of the editor for
  finding and replacing text, with live match highlighting, a match count,
  next/previous navigation, and "Ersetzen"/"Alle ersetzen".
- "Tastenkürzel" - a native keyboard-shortcuts overview (Ctrl+?), linked
  from the primary menu next to "Einstellungen".
- "Weiterlesen" marker: a lone `<!--more-->` line now exports as WordPress's
  `wp:more` block (instead of the generic HTML passthrough), with a new
  editor toolbar button to insert it.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- Pasting an image from the clipboard (Ctrl+V) - a screenshot, or "Copy
  Image" from a browser - now saves it as a new file in the article's own
  folder and inserts it, instead of doing nothing. Pasting plain text still
  works exactly as before.
- Local autosave / crash-recovery: while the article has unsaved changes, a
  snapshot is written to a local recovery slot in the background. If
  Blocksmith is closed without saving (or crashes), the next launch offers
  to restore that snapshot - or discard it.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- New application icon: a pen forging content on an anvil in WordPress
  blue, replacing the earlier placeholder (a plain gradient square with
  three bars).

## [0.26.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- "Über Blocksmith" - a native About dialog reachable from a new primary
  menu (the header bar's hamburger button, alongside "Einstellungen"),
  showing the version (kept in sync with `Cargo.toml`), license, and
  issue-tracker/repository links, plus the full version history from
  `CHANGELOG.md` as its browsable "Neuigkeiten" release notes.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- "Zuletzt geöffnet" - a header-bar button next to "Öffnen" listing the ten
  most recently opened/saved articles (most-recent-first), for one-click
  reopening without navigating the file picker again.
- A message typed into the Chat tab now gets the editor's current selection
  - or, if nothing's selected, the whole article - appended before it's
  sent, matching the rule the context menu's AI actions (built-in and
  custom) already followed. Only the typed message itself shows in the
  chat bubble.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- A header-bar toggle button collapses the whole right-hand pane (Vorschau/
  Gutenberg-Code/Statistik/Chat) for a full-width editor, and restores it
  again.

### Changed

- Removed "Übersetzen" from the editor context menu's built-in AI actions,
  along with its target-language settings ("KI-Prompts" now has five
  built-in prompts instead of six).
- The export dialog's "Vorschau" and "Medien" tabs now share the same
  margins/spacing, so switching between them no longer visibly shifts the
  content's inset within the dialog.

### Fixed

- The editor context menu showed two separator lines back to back between
  "KI-Alternativtext generieren…" and "KI-Aktionen" - a `gio::Menu` nested
  inside another section's contents draws its own separator on top of the
  outer one. Flattened the menu structure so there's exactly one.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Every image in the Vorschau now shows small badges in its bottom-right
  corner: an upload arrow (↑) once it's on WordPress, "Alt" once its alt
  text is defined, and its file format (PNG/WEBP/…) - in that fixed order
  (Upload-Status, Alt, Bildformat) whenever more than one applies. Updates
  immediately from Medienverwaltung's upload button and the manual/AI
  alt-text dialogs, not only on the next edit to the article text.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- The main window now remembers its size (and maximized state) across
  restarts instead of always reopening at a fixed 1280×800 - saved on
  close, restored on the next launch. The editor/preview split always
  opens exactly 50/50, whatever size the window opens at.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- **KI-Alternativtext generieren…** - right-click an image (its `![alt](src)`
  line in the editor, or the rendered image itself in the Vorschau pane) to
  have the active KI-Chat provider look at the actual image and propose an
  accessible alt text, at a choice of three detail levels ("Standard (kurz &
  bündig)", "Ausführlich", "Hohe Genauigkeit"). The suggestion is shown for
  review and can be corrected before it's applied; applying it writes
  straight into the same field the manual alt-text editor and
  Medienverwaltung already use, so it's what the WordPress media upload
  sends - no separate step. Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, and Ollama (a
  vision-capable local model) are all supported.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-09-04

### Changed

- "KI-Chat" settings: removed the "Speichern" button - it was easy to miss,
  which meant the API key, provider, model, and Ollama base URL could look
  entered but silently not be saved. Each now persists on its own trigger
  instead: the API key saves automatically right after it verifies
  successfully against the provider's live API (a failed check is never
  saved), provider/model choice save the moment you pick them, and the
  Ollama base URL saves as you type (debounced).

## [0.19.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- "Alternativtext festlegen…" in the editor's right-click context menu -
  right-clicking a line with an image reference (`![Beschreibung](bild.png)`)
  opens a small dialog for just that image's alt text and caption, backed
  by the same data Medienverwaltung already edits. Alt text and caption
  previously required opening Medienverwaltung (or the export dialog's
  "Medien" tab) to reach at all.



### Fixed

- Local images referenced in the article (`![alt](photo.png)`) never
  rendered in the preview - the `WebView` had no base URI to resolve a
  relative path against, so it simply couldn't find the file. The preview
  now defaults to searching for it in the article's own folder, updated
  automatically whenever the article is opened, saved for the first time,
  or reset ("Neu"/opened from WordPress).
- Removed "Zurück", "Vor", and "Anhalten" from the preview's right-click
  context menu - navigation history controls that never applied to a
  rendered article preview in the first place.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Medienverwaltung is now embedded directly in the "Artikel exportieren"
  dialog as a "Medien" tab next to "Vorschau", so alt text, captions, and
  WordPress upload state can be checked and fixed right before publishing,
  not just from the separate Ctrl+Shift+M dialog (which still exists
  unchanged).
- A new image's caption is now seeded from its Markdown bracket text
  (`![Bildunterschrift](bild.png)`) when no explicit `"title"` is present -
  previously the caption stayed empty unless the rarely-used quoted-title
  syntax was used, even though the bracket text is the only description
  most images ever get. The title, when present, still takes priority.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- A second button, "Als Entwurf hochladen", in the "Artikel exportieren"
  dialog alongside "Veröffentlichen" - each sends its own status
  (draft/publish) explicitly, regardless of whatever the separate
  "Artikel-Eigenschaften" dialog's status field currently holds, so
  publishing directly vs. uploading a draft first is now an unambiguous
  choice made right in the publish dialog. Clicking either updates the
  same WordPress post (via its already-tracked id) rather than creating a
  new one, and both buttons are disabled together while a request is in
  flight so they can't race each other.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Publishing/updating an article re-uploaded every local image to
  WordPress's media library from scratch on every single export, creating
  a duplicate attachment each time - the automatic export-time upload path
  and the Medienverwaltung's per-image tracking were two disconnected
  systems, and the former also never sent alt text or caption. Unified:
  export now reconciles against the same tracked media list Medienverwaltung
  uses, and skips uploading an image whose content (SHA-256) still matches
  what's already on the server - "bei Bedarf hochladen", not on every
  export. A changed local image is uploaded as a new attachment (WordPress
  has no way to replace an existing one's file) with the superseded one
  then deleted, and its filename/alt text/caption are always sent together,
  whether the upload happens automatically at export time or manually via
  Medienverwaltung's "Zu WordPress hochladen".

## [0.14.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Featured-image picker in "Artikel-Eigenschaften" - a file-picker button
  next to the field, matching the editor body's "Bild einfügen", instead
  of only being able to type a path by hand.
- Table-insert toolbar button - inserts a minimal 2x2 Markdown table
  template with the first header cell pre-selected. The Gutenberg engine
  already fully supported tables both directions; there was just no
  toolbar shortcut for writing one.
- "Bestehenden Artikel verlinken…" toolbar button - a searchable picker
  listing the site's existing posts by title; picking one inserts a real
  Markdown link (`[title](permalink)`) at the cursor, so cross-linking
  your own articles no longer means copying a URL by hand first.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Images whose filename or path contains a space were silently invisible
  everywhere: not recognized as an image in the preview, not picked up by
  Medienverwaltung, and not converted to a `wp:image` block on export -
  plain Markdown's `![alt](destination)` syntax stops parsing at the first
  unescaped space, so `![](my photo.png)` was just literal text. Fixed by
  wrapping such a destination in `<...>` (equally valid CommonMark, and
  transparently stripped back off by any compliant parser) wherever
  Blocksmith writes an image reference itself: "Bild einfügen"'s file
  picker, and the WordPress-import reverse converter.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- "Bild einfügen…" button in the editor toolbar - opens a native file
  picker (filtered to images) and inserts a real Markdown image reference
  at the cursor, using a path relative to the document's own folder when
  possible. Previously the only way to reference an image was to type its
  filename by hand.
- The Medienverwaltung's caption field is now seeded from the Markdown
  image's optional `"title"` (`![alt](src "title")`) the first time an
  image is seen, the same way alt text is already seeded from the Markdown
  alt - once set, it's no longer overwritten by later Markdown edits, so
  edits made in the dialog itself always win.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Per-image media management ("Medienverwaltung", Strg+Umschalt+M): every
  image referenced in the article gets its own alt text, caption, and
  WordPress upload state, independent of the Markdown source.
  - Alt text is a three-state value, not a plain on/off: **not yet
    defined** (flagged by the "N von M Bildern haben noch keinen
    Alternativtext" hint), **deliberately empty** (for decorative images -
    an explicit switch, not treated as an error), or **defined text**.
  - Caption is a separate field from alt text - the app never derives one
    from the other.
  - "Zu WordPress hochladen" uploads the image via the real REST API,
    sends the file, filename, alt text and caption, and stores the
    resulting media id/URL so re-opening the article recognizes it as
    already uploaded and never re-uploads by accident. Upload state
    (not uploaded / uploading / uploaded / failed) is shown per image; a
    failed or slow upload never touches the locally held article.
  - Metadata is persisted alongside the rest of the document in the
    existing `.md` frontmatter (a new `media_json` line) - no new file
    format yet; this lays the groundwork for the planned `.bsm` project
    container.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- "Von WordPress öffnen" now groups posts into "Entwürfe" and
  "Veröffentlicht" sections (plus a catch-all "Weitere" for pending/
  scheduled/private posts), instead of one flat list - drafts are shown
  first, since that's usually what you're looking for.

### Fixed

- Scroll-sync froze while scrolling through a long fenced code block:
  the whole block was a single scroll-sync anchor, so the preview stayed
  pinned to the block's first line for however many lines the block
  spanned, only jumping once you scrolled past it entirely. Each line
  inside a code block now gets its own anchor, so the preview tracks
  smoothly through long code samples too.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Font selection for both the editor and the preview, in "Erscheinungsbild"
  - each gets its own `Gtk.FontDialogButton` (family, size, weight and style
    all in the one native GNOME font picker) with a "reset" button, unset
    by default so the editor keeps the system monospace font and each
    preview style keeps its own typeface until customized.
  - A live sample accompanies each: the editor's is a small read-only
    Markdown source view (reflecting the current color scheme *and* font,
    porting GNOME Builder's `GbpEditoruiPreview` pattern - the same live
    sample it shows in both its "Erscheinungsbild" and "Fonts & Styling"
    pages); the preview's is a small rendered sample article, updating
    live as the style, font, or light/dark mode changes.

## [0.10.3] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- The toolbar row above the preview tabs didn't match the one above the
  editor - it used `Adw.HeaderBar` (its own themed background and height)
  while the editor's is a plain `Gtk.Box`, so the two never quite lined up
  (background color, row height, and the separator line beneath each) and
  the mismatch varied by theme/style. Replaced the `Adw.HeaderBar` with a
  plain `Gtk.Box` using the exact same margins as the editor's toolbar, so
  both rows are now visually identical in every theme.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Scroll-sync felt laggy and made the preview jump instead of scroll: the
  editor-to-preview sync was debounced (cancel-and-reschedule on every
  scroll event), which only ever fires once scrolling has stopped - the
  preview sat frozen for the whole scroll gesture, then snapped to the
  final position. Switched to a throttle (fires at once, then at most
  once per ~60ms while scrolling continues, with a trailing call so the
  final position is never dropped), so the preview now visibly tracks the
  editor throughout the scroll instead of only catching up afterward.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- Moved the preview style picker (Modern/Klassisch/Sepia) out of the
  Vorschau tab and into the "Erscheinungsbild" settings page, in a new
  "Vorschau" group next to the interface and editor color-scheme pickers -
  it's a look-and-feel setting, not something that needs to sit in the tab
  itself. Choosing a style there still applies immediately to an already-
  open preview, the same as the other appearance settings.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- The preview now follows the app's light/dark mode - it previously always
  rendered as plain black-on-white regardless of theme. Colors are baked
  into the generated HTML per render (not left to a `prefers-color-scheme`
  media query), so it updates immediately when the theme changes, even
  without retyping.
- Three selectable preview styles - Modern (the previous look), Klassisch
  (serif, justified, indented paragraphs), and Sepia (warm sepia-toned,
  with its own light and dark variant) - picked from a dropdown above the
  Vorschau tab, persisted across restarts.
- A footer status bar showing word count and estimated reading time for
  the whole article, plus the same two numbers for the current selection
  whenever one is active.

### Fixed

- The right pane's tab switcher only visually grouped the *active* tab
  into a pill shape, leaving the others as loose, ungrouped buttons.
  Switched from `Adw.ViewSwitcher` to `Adw.InlineViewSwitcher`, which
  renders all tabs as one seamless linked pill, and packed it left-aligned
  in its header bar rather than as a centered title widget - this also
  surfaced and fixed a bug where, without an explicit title widget,
  `Adw.HeaderBar` fell back to showing the window's own title ("Blocksmith")
  as a stray extra tab-like segment next to the real ones.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- The "Erscheinungsbild" page now adopts GNOME Builder's actual
  implementation rather than an approximation of it: the interface-style
  cards use Builder's own bundled preview illustrations
  (`data/icons/appearance-preview/`, CC BY-SA 4.0, see the `ATTRIBUTION.md`
  there) instead of a hand-drawn CSS mockup, and the color-scheme grid uses
  GtkSourceView's `StyleSchemePreview` widget in a `GtkFlowBox` - the same
  widget and layout Builder's own scheme selector uses - filtered to the
  schemes matching the current light/dark mode (a Rust port of Builder's
  `ide_source_style_scheme_is_dark()` heuristic) instead of showing every
  installed scheme at once. The live code-sample preview added in 0.9.1 was
  removed again at the user's request - not something Blocksmith needs.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- The "Erscheinungsbild" page's theme picker didn't actually look like GNOME
  Builder's - it used plain text toggle buttons instead of Builder's mini
  window-mockup preview cards, and the color-scheme swatch grid had no live
  code sample above it the way Builder's does. Rebuilt to match: each of
  "Dem System folgen"/"Hell"/"Dunkel" is now a card with a small mockup
  window (header strip, a couple of text-line bars, one accent-colored) -
  "Dem System folgen" shows a light/dark split - with the selected card
  getting an accent-colored border, and a live syntax-highlighted Rust
  sample now sits above the scheme swatch grid, updating immediately as a
  different scheme is picked.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- **API-key verification and model discovery**: entering an API key in
  Einstellungen now calls the provider's `/models` endpoint on a background
  thread (debounced) as soon as you stop typing, reporting "✓ Verbindung
  erfolgreich" (with the number of models found) or the provider's error
  message directly - this call doubles as the model list for the "Modell"
  picker, which is now a searchable dropdown fed from what the account
  actually has access to (cached to disk so it's available offline
  afterward), rather than a free-text field. Ollama gets the same check
  keyed off its base URL instead of a key.
- **Model choice from the Chat tab itself**: a small provider/model row at
  the top of the tab lets you switch models without opening Einstellungen;
  the choice is persisted the same way as the settings picker.
- **Markdown-rendered replies**: the model's answers are now parsed as
  Markdown and shown as Pango markup in the bubble (bold/italic/strikethrough,
  inline code, fenced code blocks, links, headings, lists), instead of raw
  Markdown source; long unbroken tokens (URLs, code) now wrap correctly.
- **AI actions in the editor's context menu**: right-clicking the editor
  now offers "Übersetzen" (into any of a configurable list of target
  languages), "Inhalt prüfen", "Stil & Formatierung prüfen", "Rechtschreibung
  prüfen", "Zeichensetzung prüfen", and "Länge anpassen…" (a small dialog for
  the target word/character count and whether it should be hit exactly or
  approximately). Each sends the current selection - or, if nothing is
  selected, the whole article - to the Chat tab together with a matching
  prompt template, and switches to that tab to show the reply. A "KI-Prompts"
  settings page lets you edit any of these six built-in prompts (resettable
  to their defaults, independently of each other), edit the translation
  language list, and define your own custom prompts (title + template),
  kept in a separate "Eigene Prompts" group so they're never confused with
  the built-ins - both also show up in the context menu, live-updated as
  you edit them without restarting the app.
- The Einstellungen button in the header bar now uses the classic hamburger
  icon (`open-menu-symbolic`) instead of a gear.

### Fixed

- `Adw.ExpanderRow` titles (used for the prompt-editor rows) interpret
  their title as Pango markup by default; a literal `&` in a prompt's title
  (e.g. "Stil & Formatierung prüfen") crashed markup parsing with a GTK
  critical. Fixed by building these rows with `use_markup(false)`, since the
  titles are always plain text.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- **Multiple LLM providers for the Chat tab**: alongside Gemini, the chat
  can now use ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), or Ollama (self-hosted,
  no API key). `src/gemini.rs` was replaced by `src/llm.rs`, a single
  blocking client (`llm::Client`) that speaks each provider's REST shape
  (Gemini's `generateContent`, OpenAI's `chat/completions`, Anthropic's
  `messages`, Ollama's `api/chat`). The "KI-Chat" settings page gained a
  provider picker; API keys are stored per-provider in the Secret Service
  (`secrets::store_llm_api_key`/`load_llm_api_key`, keyed by provider id),
  and each provider keeps its own model id, with Ollama additionally
  getting a configurable base URL (default `http://localhost:11434`). The
  shared system prompt is unaffected - it still applies regardless of which
  provider is active.
- A **Gutenberg-Code tab** (`src/codeview.rs`) next to "Vorschau", showing
  the exact block-comment-annotated HTML that would be published, updated
  live from the same debounced pipeline as the preview and statistics tabs.
- **GNOME Builder-style appearance settings** (`src/appearance.rs`): a new
  "Erscheinungsbild" page with a light/dark/follow-system toggle
  (`Adw.StyleManager`) and an editor color-scheme picker using
  GtkSourceView's own `StyleSchemeChooserWidget` (the same swatch-grid
  widget Builder itself uses) - both persisted under
  `~/.config/blocksmith/`.

### Fixed

- Scroll-sync between the editor and the preview never actually moved the
  preview. Root cause: `sourceview5::View::iter_at_location()` unreliably
  returns `None` at the buffer's left edge once the line-number gutter is
  shown. Replaced pixel-based line detection on the editor side with a
  fraction-based estimate (`estimate_visible_line`, unit-tested) - correct
  here because editor lines are uniform height, unlike the preview side
  (where the image-height mismatch this feature originally cared about is
  already handled separately via `data-line` snapping).
- Opening an existing WordPress post left its featured image blank on
  re-export. `Frontmatter` gained a `featured_media_id` field (the post's
  *current* featured media id, distinct from `featured_image`'s "upload
  this new local file" meaning) so importing a post and exporting it again
  without touching the featured image keeps the original one instead of
  silently dropping it.
- The placeholder chat tab icon (a nonexistent `chat-symbolic`) is now the
  real `chat-message-new-symbolic`; a full audit of every `-symbolic` icon
  name in the codebase against the installed Adwaita icon theme turned up
  no other placeholders.
- The right-hand tab switcher (Vorschau/Gutenberg-Code/Statistik/Chat) is
  now hosted in a real `Adw.HeaderBar`, the standard GNOME pattern (also
  used by Builder and Text Editor) for a properly grouped pill switcher,
  instead of a loose `Adw.ViewSwitcher` next to the pane.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Gemini-backed chat in a third "Chat" tab (next to "Vorschau"/"Statistik"),
  with message bubbles (`src/chat.rs`) - user messages right-aligned,
  Gemini's replies left-aligned, styled via libadwaita's named theme
  colors so they adapt to light/dark mode. Sends run on a background
  thread (`src/gemini.rs`, blocking `ureq` client for the Generative
  Language API, same rationale as `wpclient` for not using `reqwest`/
  `tokio`), keeping the full conversation history as context for each
  request.
- A "KI-Chat" page in Einstellungen (`src/chatsettings.rs`): Gemini API key
  (stored in the Secret Service via `secrets.rs`, never in plain text) and
  model id, plus a full editable/resettable system prompt
  (`src/chatconfig.rs`) - auto-saved as you type, with a "Zurücksetzen"
  button (enabled only when the prompt has actually been customized) that
  reverts to the built-in default. That default (`src/default_prompt.rs`)
  is a full editorial style guide for an anonymous German-language Linux/
  Open-Source tech writer, provided by the user.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Categories/tags cache (`src/termcache.rs`): loaded from disk at startup
  (`~/.cache/blocksmith/terms.json`) so the properties dialog's
  autocomplete has data immediately, refreshed automatically in the
  background at every launch, and refreshable on demand via a button next
  to "Artikel-Eigenschaften". Replaces the previous per-dialog-open fetch
  that started empty every time and was discarded on close.
- "Von WordPress öffnen" (`src/importer.rs`, header bar or Ctrl+Shift+O):
  lists existing posts on the configured site; picking one fetches its
  full content and metadata, resolves category/tag ids back to names, and
  converts the Gutenberg block HTML back to Markdown via the new
  `gutenberg::gutenberg_to_markdown` (the reverse of
  `markdown_to_gutenberg`, `crates/gutenberg/src/reverse.rs`) so the
  article opens as editable Markdown with its `wp_post_id` already set -
  exporting it afterward updates the same post. The reverse converter is a
  hand-rolled block-comment scanner (not a general HTML parser), with unit
  tests round-tripping every block type our forward converter produces,
  plus a live test creating a real post, fetching it back, and converting
  it - verifying actual WordPress storage/serving round-trips cleanly, not
  just in-memory conversion.
- `wpclient` gained `list_posts`, `get_post`, and `get_term_name` to back
  the above.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- "Von WordPress löschen" button in the export dialog, shown once an
  article has a `wp_post_id` (i.e. it's been published/updated at least
  once). Asks for confirmation (`Adw.AlertDialog`, destructive-styled
  "Löschen" response) before permanently deleting the post via
  `wpclient::Client::delete_post`, then clears `wp_post_id` so a later
  export creates a fresh post instead of trying to update a deleted one.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Scroll-sync between editor and preview (`src/preview.rs`, `wire_scroll_sync`
  in `src/window.rs`): scrolling the editor scrolls the preview to match,
  keyed by *source line* rather than scroll percentage - each rendered
  block carries a `data-line` attribute for its starting Markdown line, so
  a block that renders far taller than its one source line (an image, a
  large table) doesn't throw off the sync the way a naive proportional
  mapping would.
- Spell-checking in the editor via [`libspelling`](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libspelling)
  (the GTK4-native successor to gspell, which was never ported to GTK4):
  squiggly-underlines misspelled words and adds correction suggestions to
  the editor's context menu, using the system's hunspell dictionaries.
- "Einstellungen" (settings) dialog: a proper `Adw.PreferencesDialog`
  (`src/settings.rs`) replacing the standalone WordPress-connection dialog,
  which is now one page within it (`connection::build_page`). Reachable
  from the header bar or Ctrl+, (moved off "Artikel-Eigenschaften", which
  now has no reserved accelerator, freeing Ctrl+, for its conventional
  GNOME meaning).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-01

Editor ergonomics and distribution: a formatting toolbar, a document
statistics view, category/tag autocomplete, in-app error notifications, and
a working Flatpak package.

### Added

- Grouped formatting toolbar above the editor (`src/formatting.rs`):
  cut/copy/paste, bold/italic/strikethrough, heading/quote/code/code block,
  lists, and link insertion, each button visually joined into its logical
  group ("linked" style). Keyboard shortcuts for bold (Ctrl+B), italic
  (Ctrl+I) and link (Ctrl+K); cut/copy/paste already had GtkSourceView's own
  bindings.
- "Statistik" tab next to "Vorschau" (`src/stats.rs`, `Adw.ViewStack` +
  `Adw.ViewSwitcher`, left-aligned): word/character/paragraph counts and
  estimated reading time, updating live alongside the preview.
- Autocomplete for the categories/tags fields in the properties dialog
  (`src/autocomplete.rs`): fetches existing terms from the configured
  WordPress site in the background and suggests matches in a popover as you
  type after the last comma.
- In-app error notifications (`Adw.ToastOverlay`) for file open/save
  failures, replacing silent `eprintln!` calls that only showed up in a
  terminal the user wasn't looking at.
- Flatpak packaging: manifest (`build-aux/flatpak/`), `.desktop` entry,
  AppStream metainfo, and an app icon under `data/`. Targets
  `org.gnome.Platform` 49, which already bundles GTK4/libadwaita/
  GtkSourceView5/WebKitGTK 6.0, so the only extra SDK piece needed is the
  Rust toolchain extension. Verified with a real `flatpak-builder` build,
  installed and run sandboxed.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-01

The app can now actually do the thing it's for: write Markdown, review the
generated Gutenberg HTML, and publish or update a real WordPress post.

### Added

- WordPress REST API client (`src/wpclient.rs`, blocking `ureq`-based):
  create/update posts, upload media, resolve-or-create category/tag terms
  by name, delete a post.
- "Artikel exportieren" dialog (`src/export.rs`): shows the generated
  Gutenberg block HTML before sending, then publishes/updates the post on a
  background thread (so the network round trip never blocks the UI) and
  writes the returned WordPress post id back into the document's
  frontmatter so a later export updates the same post instead of creating a
  duplicate. Reachable from the header bar or Ctrl+Shift+P.
- Local images referenced in the Markdown (`![alt](local/path.png)`) are
  uploaded to the WordPress media library at export time and the generated
  `wp:image` block is rewritten to point at the resulting hosted URL.
- Licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later (`LICENSE`, `license` field in both crates'
  `Cargo.toml`).

### Testing

- `wpclient` and `export` each have an `#[ignore]`d test exercising the full
  flow (category/tag resolution, media upload, create, update, delete)
  against a real, already-configured WordPress site rather than a mock —
  run explicitly with `cargo test -- --ignored`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-01

Initial development release: a working foundation, not yet able to publish
to WordPress.

### Added

- Split-pane editor window (GTK4 + libadwaita): a `GtkSourceView` Markdown
  editor on the left with markdown syntax highlighting, a `WebKitWebView`
  live HTML preview on the right, debounced re-rendering on every edit.
- Basic document actions: New / Open / Save for plain `.md` files
  (Ctrl+N/O/S), via GTK4's `FileDialog`.
- Markdown → Gutenberg block-comment HTML engine (`crates/gutenberg`),
  standalone and unit-tested independently of the GUI. Maps paragraphs,
  headings (with the `level` attribute only when it differs from the
  default), nested lists (`core/list` + `core/list-item`, WP 6.3+ format),
  block quotes, fenced code blocks, standalone images, thematic breaks,
  tables, and raw HTML blocks.
- Document frontmatter: title, slug, status (draft/pending/publish),
  categories, tags, featured image path, and WordPress post id, stored as a
  small hand-rolled YAML-like frontmatter block at the top of the `.md`
  file. Editable via an "Artikel-Eigenschaften" dialog reachable from the
  header bar or Ctrl+,.
- WordPress connection settings dialog: site URL and username are stored in
  a plain config file; the Application Password is stored in the Secret
  Service (GNOME Keyring, or the portal equivalent under Flatpak) via `oo7`,
  never written to disk in plain text.
